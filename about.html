    <h2>Our Story</h2>
     
    <p>Ever since she was a little girl, Sydney has loved to bake. So when she was fired from her job in advertising in 2008, Sydney decided from that moment on she was going to do what she loved. Drawing on inspiration from the care-free rock 'n roll culture of the <em>60's and 70's</em> and the idea that people should be able to taste more flavors without that post-dessert guilt trip, Sydney engaged the help of some key people in her life, and in 2009 opened the first <em>Little Miss Cupcake</em>, in <em>New York City's SoHo</em> district.</p>
